# How to to inform the people about the repair cafe

First of all the repair cafe is for free, meaning devices that can be fixed without aspare are handled.

- Radio announcement
- Telling friends and Family
- Adding other ads? Or just telling everyone "free repairs"
- Posts on social media plattforms
- include the community in the process so they might learn themselves on what to do next time it breaks

=> all these will attract the communities

However the gesture of welcoming the community members to this will spice it up.

### The most meaningful one is doing it together!
